        Why not grab this opportunity to learn the basics of yoga in a healthy harmless way made just for you?
        Nowadays it is not uncommon to injure our body while practicing activities meant to do exactly the opposite.
        We find that yoga injuries have become a common terminology in the surgeon's jargon.
        These can be avoided by learning yoga from a qualified teacher so that different practices are learned progressively in the most gentle way to the body.

      <p class="lead">
        Yoga is a deep personal process and has to be accessed slowly without any kind of force on the body,mind and heart.
        Non-violence is the first and foremost requirement for any practice to be called yogic.
        Yoga is not gymnastics but rather the yoga posture should involve comfort and stability.
        If it isn’t so, it is not yogic.
        For the rejuvenating process to be activated, physical as well as psychological cleansing is needed.
        Seize the chance of meeting a yoga therapist to learn to live your life free from the negative clutches of past and go back home for a fresh start.

          Harmony and peace in yoga is a platform dedicated to inspire people to live a happy and healthy life through yoga. Yoga is an ancient science designed for working towards the ultimate purpose of man’s life, self-realisation. On the journey towards knowing our true self, all the systems get balanced and reorganised in its natural state; health gets re-established naturally as a side product of yoga.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          The Panchakosa (pancha:five, kosha:body/cover/sheath) concept divides our body in 5 bodies/sheaths:<br />
           1. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosha#Annamaya_kosha" target="_blank"> annamaya</a> (physical), <br />
           2. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosha#Pranamaya_kosha" target="_blank">pranamaya</a> (life force, breath), <br />
           3. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosha#Manomaya_kosha" target="_blank">manomaya</a> (mind, thoughts/emotions),<br />
           4. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosha#Vijnanamaya_kosha" target="_blank">vijyanamaya</a> (intellect, power of discrimination) and <br />
           5. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosha#Anandamaya_kosha" target="_blank" >anandamaya</a> (bliss/beyond the rest) kosa.<br /><br />
           These sheaths or bodies are not distinctly separate but interlinked and overlap each other so that disorder in one of them will cause disharmony in all the rest ending in disease.
           Through yoga, these bodies are purified and are allowed to aligned to achieve overall integrity therefore automatically regaining our natural state of being that is optimal health and much more. We leave this for you to discover.

          Undoubtedly, many people have been treated and even cured of certain diseases through yoga which has been found to be of great help in managing musculoskeletal diseases, emotional disorders and psychosomatic diseases depending on the student’s willpower and devotion.
          At hapi yoga, we are not claiming to produce miracles but are making an attempt to prevent further deterioration of already established diseases by a daily consistent practice of certain techniques customised to the individual’s needs and limitations.

          Dr Manjusha Coonjan is a general medical practitioner with past working experience in various fields (approx. 9 years spent as a senior medical and health officer in Victoria Hospital,one of the major public hospitals of Mauritius). Based on the benefits of yoga on her own health, she decided to go for a more formal training in this field. The comparatively new subject of yoga therapy had emerged shortly and was the next step. Having completed postgraduate studies in Yoga Therapy at Kaivalyadhama, Lonavla, India, she is well-equipped to help patients feel better through a lifestyle-modifying method tailor-made for each patient accompanied by a continuous medical follow-up.

        <h3>What We Offer:</h3>
        <p class="lead text-info" >
          Kindly note that the word students and patients are used interchangeably. All clients sick or healthy are students basically.
        </p>

        <h3>Individual consultation:</h3>
        <p class="lead">
          This is the first meeting and a compulsory step followed by individual beginner classes.
        </p>

        <h3>Individual beginner classes:</h3>
        <p class="lead">
          At least 3 of these are needed for being admitted in group classes.
        </p>

        <h3>Group classes:</h3>
        <p class="lead">
           For students who had been consulted and have had at least 3 individual classes.
           Yoga is an individual path.
           This is a platform to meet other yoga practitioners and use the group energy for motivation to go further into your own practice or simply to make more effort towards steadiness and regularity in your own practice.
        </p>

        <h3>Special group classes:</h3>
        <p class="lead">
           Classes for specific conditions like low back ache, asthma, etc.
        </p>

        <h3>Short course:</h3>
        <p class="lead">
          Designed especially for foreign visitors, it starts with an individual consultation and followed by practical classes under supervision devised according to length of stay of the student.
          On this note, all students/patients should make sure that they be as punctual and regular as possible with their practice. As we eat and sleep everyday, yoga must become part of your life for any benefit to be evident, and it all starts with one step at a time.
