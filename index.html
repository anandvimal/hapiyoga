        <h2 >Harmony and peace in yoga (hapi yoga)</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          Harmony And Peace In Yoga (HAPI Yoga) is a platform dedicated to inspire people to live a happy and healthy life through yoga. Yoga is an ancient science designed for working towards the ultimate purpose of man’s life, self-realisation. On the journey towards knowing our true self, all the systems get balanced and reorganised in their natural state; health gets re-established naturally as a side product of yoga.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          Hapi yoga is the sole provider of such a service in the African region where yoga is being  integrated in the treatment of different diseases and patients are followed up with the necessary medical support and investigation. The term alternative medicine has been coined due to a lack of proper scientific evidence on its mechanism of action but now with the dissemination of knowledge of the components of the Primo Vascular system or Bong-Han System which has revealed the intricate system of ‘nadis’ in yoga and ancient Indian medicine or acupuncture meridians in Chinese tradional medicine ,[<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23983793">link</a>], this branch of medicine is being seen under a new perspective.

          <h2>How yoga works</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            In yogic understanding, the Panchakosa (pancha:five, kosha:body/cover/sheath) concept divides our body in 5 bodies/sheaths:
          </p>
          <ol class="lead">
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosha#Annamaya_kosha" target="_blank"> annamaya</a> (physical),</li>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosha#Pranamaya_kosha" target="_blank">pranamaya</a> (life force, breath), </li>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosha#Manomaya_kosha" target="_blank">manomaya</a> (mind, thoughts/emotions),</li>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosha#Vijnanamaya_kosha" target="_blank">vijyanamaya</a> (intellect, power of discrimination) and </li>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosha#Anandamaya_kosha" target="_blank" >anandamaya</a> (bliss/beyond the rest) kosa.</li>
          </ol>
          <p class="lead">
            These sheaths or bodies are not distinctly separate but interlinked and overlap each other so that disorder in one of them will produce discordance in all the rest resulting in disharmony in the mind-body complex, and finally psychosomatic and organic diseases. A simple and famous example would be observing our breath, heart rate and thoughts if possible when we are angry. Here some external event perceived through our sense organs (annamaya kosa), sent as impulses to and interpreted in the brain produced an emotional reaction of anger (manomaya kosa) causing a disturbance in the bodily activities (pranamaya kosa) and loss of power of discrimination (vijyanamaya kosa) between destructive and constructive decisions. Consequently, we end up taking inappropriate action. Through yoga, these bodies are purified (through a meditative attitude while doing yogic postures, breathing techniques, contemplation, concentration and awareness) so that distressing events cause psycho-emotional imbalances to a lesser degree or not at all, depending on the level of understanding and practice, and thus are taken with a cool mind which is a prerequisite to make the right decision needed to solve the problem. With time, harmony and peace in yoga (anandamaya kosa) is achieved through natural alignment and integration of these levels or bodies . Optimal health is only a drop of our natural unhindered state which encompasses much more...we leave it for you to discover.

              Ms Bi Xin Xin was born and grew up in south China.

With this dissatisfaction, she tried a three-week course in the yoga foundation at Kaivalyadhama, Lonavla, India in 2013. The latter is a well-established and one of the genuinely traditional yoga institutes in India. She then decided to quit her job, and stay at Kaivalyadhama for a formal training in yoga therapy to treat herself optimally. In 2016, she completed the Postgraduate Diploma course in Yoga Therapy as well as noted a huge improvement in her own health. Now she is planning to share her experience and techniques she learned from all her teachers and friends in India, to assist each individual to counteract their stress in daily life, therefore reach a highly achievable state of balance at physical and emotional levels.</p>

        <hr/>

        <h2>What we offer:</h2>
        <p class="text-info lead">
          Kindly note that the word students and patients are used interchangeably. All clients sick or healthy are learning how to have a holistic life and so basically are students.
        </p>

        <p class="lead">Our selection of services include Yoga therapy (Short sessions, Individual & Group classes, Short courses); Marma therapy; Health & Fitness Consultancy; Medical Consultations; Postural Alignment; Counseling & Life Coaching; Yoga & Meditation Retreats; Residential Programs. Some of these have been described below.</p>

        <h2>Individual consultation:</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          This is a recommended step needed for devising the individual beginner classes. It consists of a medical checkup including basic postural analysis and overall psychophysical assessment. Accordingly, the different practices of yoga (elements of postural alignment, modified postures, breathing techniques, cleansing processes and maybe chanting of mantra depending on the student’s affinity) are prescribed.
        </p>

        <h2>Individual beginner classes:</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          At least 3 of these are advised before admission in group classes. During the beginner classes, the student will be taught the practices that have been prescribed during consultation and subsequently adjusted and corrected if needed.
        </p>

        <h2>Group classes:</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          These are meant for students who had been consulted and preferably have had at least 3 individual classes. Yoga is an individual path. This is a platform to meet other yoga practitioners and use the group energy for motivation to go further into or simply to make more effort towards steadiness and regularity in your own practice, under supervision.
        </p>

        <h2>Special group classes:</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          Classes for specific conditions like low back ache, asthma, stress management, deep relaxation and rejuvenation, insomnia, lethargy and low energy level, etc. Here, focus is placed on particular aspects that pertain to the specific disease. It is advised to have individual consultation and beginner’s class prior to these sessions for best result.
        </p>

        <h2>Short course:</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          Designed especially for foreign visitors, corporates, schools or any group of people sharing a common interest in yoga, it starts with an individual consultation and followed by practical classes under supervision devised according to length of stay of visitors and overall health status of the students.
        </p>

        <p class="lead">
          On this note, all students/patients should make sure that they be as punctual and regular as possible with their practice. As we eat and sleep daily, yoga must become part of our life for it to be optimal, and it all starts with one step at a time.

She had guided me throughout, by resolving all my questions, related to yoga aasans, aspects of Kriya, learning of various subjects. Becoming friend with her, I used to feel blessed listening her yogic experiences and learning. She also introduced me to various physical aspects of body (knowledge she possessed being physician) and relating the same with yogic practices and there impact on human body.
                The intense meditator in her, has facilitated meditations to huge groups of more than 60 people. I  had new silent mediational experiences bringing me a new aware life.

          <h2>Yoga as a tool for personal development, Holistic Teacher Training Workshop, July 1-15, 2016</h2>
          <img src="assets/img/teacher_training_1-15july.jpg" alt="holistic teacher training workshop for ministry of health july 2016" width="100%" />
          <p class="lead">
            From July 1 to 15, 2016, teacher trainees who are already enrolled in a program for art and physical education for the 9-year schooling program set-up by the present government (Rep. of Mauritius), participated in a workshop for personal development organized by the Ministry of Education and Human Resources, Tertiary Education and Scientific Research. Since they will be known as holistic teachers, the trainees are first and foremost being given all the techniques and knowhow for their own growth. Yoga being the path to self-knowing (and ultimately self-realisation) was naturally included in this workshop, and Dr Manjusha Coonjan delivered theoretical and practical sessions going into the philosophy being classical (Patanjali) yoga and its application. About 160 students (4 groups of 40) took part in this project and for many it was their first contact with hatha yoga. They were amazed to learn about the different facets of yoga, how its practice is beneficial for a holistic wellbeing and has now gained scientific support for therapeutic use.

          <img src="assets/img/yoga_day.jpeg" alt="international yoga day workshop" width="100%" />
          <p class="lead">
            We had the great pleasure of hosting this workshop where all the participants were keen to learn more about yoga. They came in a big number despite the cold winter Sunday morning. The yoga asana class went smoothly with a practice of traditional yoga poses mostly at a beginner's level enjoyed in a mindful way sometimes physically demanding and other times relaxing mode. Our theoretical session was gladly stretched over its time limit with the zealous interaction on philosophical and scientific aspects of yoga. Clarification on the right way of performing different breathing techniques was given and practiced. Our workshop ended with deep relaxation and rejuvenation session in yoga nidra.
