        <h2 >Harmony and peace in yoga (hapi yoga)</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          Harmony And Peace In Yoga (HAPI Yoga) is a platform dedicated to inspire people to live a happy and healthy life through yoga. Yoga is an ancient science designed for working towards the ultimate purpose of man’s life, self-realisation. On the journey towards knowing our true self, all the systems get balanced and reorganised in their natural state; health gets re-established naturally as a side product of yoga.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          Hapi yoga is the sole provider of such a service in the African region where yoga is being  integrated in the treatment of different diseases and patients are followed up with the necessary medical support and investigation. The term alternative medicine has been coined due to a lack of proper scientific evidence on its mechanism of action but now with the dissemination of knowledge of the components of the Primo Vascular system or Bong-Han System which has revealed the intricate system of ‘nadis’ in yoga and ancient Indian medicine or acupuncture meridians in Chinese tradional medicine ,[<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23983793">link</a>], this branch of medicine is being seen under a new perspective.

          <h2>How yoga works</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            In yogic understanding, the Panchakosa (pancha:five, kosha:body/cover/sheath) concept divides our body in 5 bodies/sheaths:
          </p>
          <ol class="lead">
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosha#Annamaya_kosha" target="_blank"> annamaya</a> (physical),</li>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosha#Pranamaya_kosha" target="_blank">pranamaya</a> (life force, breath), </li>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosha#Manomaya_kosha" target="_blank">manomaya</a> (mind, thoughts/emotions),</li>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosha#Vijnanamaya_kosha" target="_blank">vijyanamaya</a> (intellect, power of discrimination) and </li>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosha#Anandamaya_kosha" target="_blank" >anandamaya</a> (bliss/beyond the rest) kosa.</li>
          </ol>
          <p class="lead">
            These sheaths or bodies are not distinctly separate but interlinked and overlap each other so that disorder in one of them will produce discordance in all the rest resulting in disharmony in the mind-body complex, and finally psychosomatic and organic diseases. A simple and famous example would be observing our breath, heart rate and thoughts if possible when we are angry. Here some external event perceived through our sense organs (annamaya kosa), sent as impulses to and interpreted in the brain produced an emotional reaction of anger (manomaya kosa) causing a disturbance in the bodily activities (pranamaya kosa) and loss of power of discrimination (vijyanamaya kosa) between destructive and constructive decisions. Consequently, we end up taking inappropriate action. Through yoga, these bodies are purified (through a meditative attitude while doing yogic postures, breathing techniques, contemplation, concentration and awareness) so that distressing events cause psycho-emotional imbalances to a lesser degree or not at all, depending on the level of understanding and practice, and thus are taken with a cool mind which is a prerequisite to make the right decision needed to solve the problem. With time, harmony and peace in yoga (anandamaya kosa) is achieved through natural alignment and integration of these levels or bodies . Optimal health is only a drop of our natural unhindered state which encompasses much more...we leave it for you to discover.

          <h2>Who will benefit from yoga</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            In ancient times, this secular discipline was reserved for serious seekers who wanted to follow a regime to reach the ultimate or enlightenment or nirvana. In our modern generation, yoga has been modified to fit the requirement of each individual, young or old, man or woman, everybody has now access to and can now make good use of this old system. The therapeutic value of yoga has been discovered and is now at the disposal of patients with established organic diseases. However, yoga is a method of prevention and regulation so that the body is better prepared to face all types of challenges. As the old adage goes, prevention is better than cure, yoga offers a better quality of life to all its practitioners. So you are all welcome to learn yoga in a way which is specially adapted to your unique body and mental makeup through lessons given individually.

        <h2>What we offer:</h2>
        <p class="text-info lead">
          Kindly note that the word students and patients are used interchangeably. All clients sick or healthy are learning how to have a holistic life and so basically are students.
        </p>

        <h2>Individual consultation:</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          This is a compulsory step needed for devising the individual beginner classes. It consists of a medical checkup including basic postural analysis and overall psychophysical assessment. Accordingly, the different practices of yoga (elements of postural alignment, modified postures, breathing techniques, cleansing processes and maybe chanting of mantra depending on the student’s affinity) are prescribed.
        </p>

        <h2>Individual beginner classes:</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          At least 3 of these are needed for being admitted in group classes. During the beginner classes, the student will be taught the practices that have been prescribed during consultation and subsequently adjusted and corrected if needed.
        </p>

        <h2>Group classes:</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          These are meant for students who had been consulted and have had at least 3 individual classes. Yoga is an individual path. This is a platform to meet other yoga practitioners and use the group energy for motivation to go further into or simply to make more effort towards steadiness and regularity in your own practice, under supervision.
        </p>

        <h2>Special group classes:</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          Classes for specific conditions like low back ache, asthma, stress management, deep relaxation and rejuvenation, insomnia, lethargy and low energy level, etc. Here, focus is placed on particular aspects that pertain to the specific disease. It is advised to have individual consultation and beginner’s class prior to these sessions for best result.
        </p>

        <h2>Short course:</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          Designed especially for foreign visitors, it starts with an individual consultation and followed by practical classes under supervision devised according to length of stay and overall health status of the student.
        </p>

        <p class="lead">
          On this note, all students/patients should make sure that they be as punctual and regular as possible with their practice. As we eat and sleep daily, yoga must become part of our life for it to be optimal, and it all starts with one step at a time.
